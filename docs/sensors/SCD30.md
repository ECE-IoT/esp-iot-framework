## Description

The SCD-30 is an NDIR sensor, which is a 'true' CO2 sensor, that will tell you the CO2 PPM (parts-per-million) composition of ambient air. Perfect for environmental sensing, scientific experiments, air quality and ventilation studies and more.

Data is read over I2C, so it works very nicely with just about any microcontroller or microcomputer.
