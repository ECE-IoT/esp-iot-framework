# Keys and Certificates

## Why do we need a key and certificate files?

To establish a TLS connection with device authentification the following three files are neccessary:

1. Privat Key (/esp32-d1mini-01.private.key)
2. Device Certificate (/esp32-d1mini-01.cert.crt)
3. Root Certificate (/root-CA.pem)

You get these files from AWS and the process is described here (TODO Tims beschreibung einf√ºgen)
These three files are stored on the [SPIFFS](esp_spiffs.md). 

To store them in the file system you just have to put the files together with the config file into the data directory and then follow the uploade process which is descibed [here](esp_spiffs.md). 

!!! attention
    It is important that the files have exactly the same name as seen in the brackets above.


## Keys Class

The purpose of this class is to read the three files from the file system and make them accessible by get...() functions. The files are read by calling the begin() function of the class.

The class uses the [EspSpiffs](esp_spiffs.md) class to read from the file system.
