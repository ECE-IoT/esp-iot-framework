# Logger

## Purpose

The purpose of the logger is to log messages with different log levels such as info, debug in a file on the SPIFFS and print the information either at the beginning of the program via the serial monitor or directly during the program, depending on the configuration

The aim of these is to inform the user about the device status and to simplify and speed up debugging.
